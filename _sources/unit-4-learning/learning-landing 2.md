# Reinforcement and Imitation Learning

* [Reinforcement learning](./rl.md) is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns to make decisions by trial and error, much like a human learns through experience. It involves an agent interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments for its actions, which helps it to learn which actions lead to desirable outcomes. Reinforcement learning has many applications, such as teaching robots to perform complex tasks, optimizing business decisions, and even playing games.

* [Imitation learning](./imitation.md) is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns to perform a task by imitating an expert's behavior. Instead of trial and error, the algorithm learns by observing the expert's actions and the corresponding outcomes. This approach has applications in fields such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, where the goal is to teach machines to perform tasks safely and efficiently by learning from human experts.
