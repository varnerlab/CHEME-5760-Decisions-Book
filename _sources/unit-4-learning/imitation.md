# Imitation Learning 
Imitation learning is a popular subfield of machine learning that involves learning from expert demonstrations. Instead of learning from scratch, an imitation learning algorithm learns to perform a task by imitating the behavior of a human or a specialist agent. The goal of imitation learning is to leverage the knowledge and expertise of an expert to train an agent more quickly and effectively than with traditional trial-and-error methods.
