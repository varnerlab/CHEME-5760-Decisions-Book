# Decision-making in uncertain situations
Making decisions in uncertain situations, potentially involving multiple agents, can be challenging. Decision-making in uncertain situations involves uncertainty and risk. Thus, in this unit, we'll introduce tools to model uncertainty, approaches to understand risk, and risk tolerance and model the actions of multiple actors involved in our decisions:

* [Probability](./probability.md) is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of randomness and uncertainty. Understanding probability is essential for making rational decisions in the face of uncertainty. It involves quantifying the likelihood or chance of a particular event occurring based on the available information.

* [Risk](./risk.md) is the possibility of an adverse outcome or loss, typically resulting from uncertainty or exposure to danger. Risk aversion is the tendency of individuals or organizations to prefer a particular outcome over an uncertain one, even if the uncertain outcome has a potentially higher expected value. Understanding risk and risk aversion is crucial for making informed decisions that involve uncertainty and can help individuals and organizations manage and mitigate potential losses.

* [Multi-agent decision making](./games.md) involves situations where multiple agents or decision makers interact and influence each other's choices. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the strategic behavior of decision-makers in such situations. Game theory provides a framework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent decision-making, including how agents interact, what actions they might take, and how they choose among possible outcomes.
