# Risk and Risk Aversion
Risk aversion in decision making refers to the tendency of individuals to prefer options with lower levels of uncertainty or potential loss. When faced with choices, risk-averse individuals prioritize minimizing potential risks over maximizing potential gains. This cognitive bias can influence various aspects of decision making, such as investment choices, career decisions, and even personal choices involving health and safety.
