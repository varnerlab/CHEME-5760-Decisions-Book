# Quantitative Decisions in Life, Love, and Finance

## Description
Decision-making is essential to almost everything facet of life. However, are you making the best possible decisions? This course introduces quantitative decision-making tools and strategies that will give students a framework to make the best possible decisions in life, love, and finance. Students will be introduced to concepts such as utility maximization using personalized happiness functions. Students will also be introduced to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to decision-making, such as Markov Decisions Processes (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Imitation Learning (IL), and Multiagent decision-making tools and methods. 

### Times, places and websites
* __Credits__: 3-credits
* __Lectures__: Lectures on TuTh 11:15 AM - 12:05 PM in XXX
* __Discussion__: Discussion on Fr 1:25 PM - 2:15 PM in XXX

### Outcomes
In this course, students will:
* Identify personalized happiness functions and use these functions, along with key concepts such as utility maximization, to make optimal decisions in personal and professional contexts.  
* Demonstrate fluency in developing and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to problems in decision-making in personal and professional contexts.  
* Interrogate process, product, and financial data sets to compute optimal decisions in offline and real-time contexts.   

### Topics
Lectures are organized into units, each having roughly four weeks of class time
* [Unit 1: Simple decisions](./unit-1-simpledecisions/simpledecisions-landing.md)
* [Unit 2: Decisions in uncertain situations](./unit-2-uncertainty/uncertainty-landing.md)
* [Unit 3: The best laid plans](./unit-3-planning/planning-landing.md)
* [Unit 4: Decision making by doing](./unit-4-learning/learning-landing.md)

## Grading
We expect this course to draw from a spectrum of students, including “those less comfortable with computing,” “those more comfortable with computing,” and those in between. However, what ultimately matters is not where you end up relative to your classmates but where you are relative to yourself. 

Each student’s final grade is individually determined at the end of the semester based on their peformance in the following components (percentages subject to change):

| Percentage | Component |
| ----------: | --------- |
| 10%	| __Participation__. Course participation (code reviews, questions and TA/course evaluations) will be an important component of the course. Participation opportunities will be identified throughout the semester. |
| 40%	| __Problem sets__. Approximately 10 problem sets will be administered over the semester. Problem sets will be distributed via Canvas (typically delivered on Friday afternoons and due one-week later). Problem sets can be completed in teams. |
| 20%	| __Mid-term exam__. One take-home, mid-term examination will be distributed. The distribution date will be announced ahead of time, and once distributed, students will have a specified number of hours (at least 36 hours) to complete the exam. |
| 30%	| __Final project__. Development of a research project by each student (semester long with additional emphasis during the final 5 weeks of the course). The projects will conclude with a written report and an oral presentation to the class near the end of the semester. The final written reports will be due on the University assigned date for final projects. |

### Grading details
* Problem sets and the final project are evaluated using correctness, design, and style, with scores computed as 3 x correctness + 2 x design + 1 x style.
* The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. The course is not graded on a curve. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not disadvantaged compared to those more comfortable.
* Remarkable effort and upward trending are considered, as is input from the teaching team. 


## Course policies and procedures
* Students must know and abide by Cornell’s Code of Academic Integrity. You may discuss problem sets with classmates, but all submitted work should be yours. Take-home exams must be completed individually without the help of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and other sources. [Please review Cornell’s academic integrity policy](http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html)
* Late problem sets: 25% will be deducted from your grade each day the homework assignment is late. Homework regrade requests should be submitted in writing within two weeks of the assignment’s return.
* Exam re-grade requests must be submitted in writing within one week of the return of the exam document. The entire exam document will be re-graded in addition to addressing the re-grade request. 
* If you need to request an extension on a problem set because of an extenuating circumstance, please get in touch with Professor Varner before the problem set is due to discuss an extension. 
* All required submissions (should there be any) must be sent to the teaching team email: (course email goes here). Each submission should include your name(s) or netID(s) on the first page of the assignment. Except for computer code, written submissions should consist of a single PDF document generated using the LaTeX document preparation system. For any computing assignments, you may be required to publish code to GitHub or submit files to Gradescope; in these cases, specific instructions and procedures will be given.
* The course will officially support numerical computing in various programming languages (open source and platform agnostic). We’ll use [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com) as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Disabilities statement
If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, please provide Professor Varner with an accommodation letter from [Student Disability Services](https://sds.cornell.edu). Students are expected to give two weeks’ notice of the need for accommodations.  

## Diversity statement
We aspire to create an environment for learning, intellectual discourse, and professional and social interactions where everyone feels welcome and valued. We recognize all course participants as responsible adults with differing perspectives based partly on their unique experiences. [We espouse the broader mission and values of the Smith School](https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/cbe/about/mission).
