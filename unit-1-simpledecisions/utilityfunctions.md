# Utility Functions
Utility functions are mathematical expressions representing an individual's preferences over different choices or outcomes. It assigns a numerical value, called utility which is a surrogate for happiness or satisfaction, to each possible option or outcome, based on how much the individual values it. However, a utility function is subjective and can vary from person to person, as different individuals may have other preferences.

This theory operates on the premise that the happiness or benefit from each extra unit decreases as a consumer increases the number of units consumed.

## Rational choice theory
[Rational Choice Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) is founded on the idea that individuals make decisions based on their preferences and the information available to them. This theory involves calculating the utility of various actions or outcomes using a utility function. The utility function is a vital aspect of this theory as it helps in determining how individuals assign numerical values to different options ({prf:ref}`defn-individual-utility`):

````{prf:definition} Ordinal utility function
:label: defn-individual-utility

An individual decision-making agent is presented with a bundle of $n$ objects $X=\left\{x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\right\}$. A utility function represents the preference of the agent for combinations of these $n$ objects:

```{math}
:label: eqn-utility-function-generic
U(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})
```

The utility function $U:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is unique only up to an order-preserving transformation in period $t\rightarrow{t+dt}$. Further, utility functions are ordinal, i.e., they rank-order bundles but do not indicate how much better a bundle is compared to another.

````

{prf:ref}`defn-individual-utility` establishes a critical concept; the utility can be used to rank order the preference for different choices. For example, suppose we have two choices, $A$ and $B$:

* If $A\succ{B}$, the decision maker _strictly prefers_ $A$ to $B$. Then, the utility of choice $A$ is greater than $B$, or $U(A)>U(B)$.
* If $A\sim{B}$, the decision maker is _indifferent_ between $A$ to $B$. Then, the utility of choice $A$ is the same as $B$, or $U(A)=U(B)$.
* If $A\succsim{B}$, the decision maker _weakly prefers_ $A$ over $B$, or they are indifferent. Then, the utility of choice $A$ is greater than or equal to $B$, or $U(A)\geq{U(A)}$.

### Utility functions
A utility function is a mathematical representation of a person's preferences over different outcomes or alternatives. There are many different classes of utility functions, let's look at a few examples and examine their properties:

* __Linear utility function__ assumes that an individual's utility is directly proportional to the quantity of goods or services consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x) = \sum{\alpha_{i}x_{i}}$, where $\alpha_{i}>0$ is a positive constant, and $x_{i}$ denotes the quantity of good or service $i$ consumed.
* __Logarithmic utility function__ assumes that an individual's utility is a function of the logarithm of the quantity consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x) = \ln(\alpha^{T}\cdot{x}+\beta)$, where $\beta>0$ is a positive constant, and $\alpha^{T}\cdot{x}$ is the scalar product of the vector of parameters $\alpha$ and goods or services $x$, where $x_{i}>0$ and $\alpha_{i}>0$.
* __Exponential utility function__ assumes that an individual's utility is proportional to the exponential of the quantity consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x) = e^{\alpha^{T}\cdot{x}}$, where $\alpha^{T}\cdot{x}$ is the scalar product of the vector of parameters $\alpha$ and the vector of goods or services $x$, where $x_{i}>0$ and $\alpha_{i}>0$.
* __Cobb-Douglas utility function__ is commonly used in economics and assumes that an individual's utility is a function of the quantity of two or more goods consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}) = \prod{x_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}}$, where $\alpha_{i}>0$ are positive constants.
* __Leontief utility function__ assumes that an individual's utility is based on the minimum amount of each attribute or variable required to achieve a certain level of satisfaction. The function is represented by the equation $U(x_{1},\dots, x_{n}) = \min\left\{\alpha_{1}x_{1},\dots,\alpha_{n}x_{n}\right\}$, where $\alpha_{i}$ are the minimum amounts required for each variable, and $x_{i}$ are the quantities consumed for variable $i$.

<!-- 
A utility function should obey the following properties: -->

<!-- * __Completeness__: A utility function should be able to rank all possible outcomes or alternatives. In other words, for any two outcomes, the utility function should tell us which one is preferred or whether they are equally preferred.
* __Transitivity__: If outcome A is preferred to outcome B, and outcome B is preferred to outcome C, then outcome A must be preferred to outcome C. This is known as the transitivity property.
* __Monotonicity__: If more of a good is always preferred to less, then the utility function should increase in that good. Conversely, if less of a bad is always preferred to more, then the utility function should decrease in that bad.
* __Continuity__: Small changes in the outcome or alternatives should result in small changes in the utility function. This is known as the continuity property.
* __Concavity__: The utility function should be concave if the person exhibits diminishing marginal utility. This means that as a person consumes more of a good, the additional satisfaction gained from each unit consumed decreases. 

These properties ensure that a utility function represents a person's preferences and can be used to make rational choices between alternatives.

#### Linear utility functions
A linear utility function is the simplest utility function. It assumes that an individual's utility is directly proportional to the quantity consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x) = \sum{\alpha_{i}x_{i}}$, where $\alpha_{i}>0$ is a positive constant ({numref}`fig-linear-utility-1d`).

(content:references:rational-choice-theory-utility-functions-log)=
#### Logarithmic utility functions
A logarithmic utility function assumes that an individual's utility is a function of the logarithm of the quantity consumed, and is represented by the equation $U(x) = \ln(x+a)$, where $a>0$ is a positive constant. The marginal utility of a logarithmic utility function is inversely proportional to the quantity consumed:

```{math}
:label: eqn-log-marginal-utility
\bar{U} = \frac{1}{x + a}
```

<!-- The shape of the marginal utility curves gives insight into how a decision maker values a particular good or service. Consider the case of how two agents feel about widgets $w$:

* __Agent A__: Let the utility function governing the satisfaction gained by Agent A generated by purchasing a widget be $U(w) = \ln\left(1+w\right)$. 
* __Agent B__: Let the utility function governing the satisfaction gained by Agent B generated by purchasing a widget be $U(w) =  \alpha\cdot{w}^2$, where $\alpha>0$.

The marginal utility of Agent A for widgets in given by:

$$\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{w}} = \frac{1}{1+w}$$ -->
