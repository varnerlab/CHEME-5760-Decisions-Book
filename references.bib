@article{MCFADDEN1980,
	abstract = {This paper reviews several recent developments in econometric demand analysis which may be of interest in market research. Econometric models of probabilistic choice, suitable for forecasting choice among existing or new brands, or switching between brands, are surveyed. These models incorporate attribute descriptions of commodities, making them statistical counterparts of the Court-Griliches-Lancaster theory of consumer behavior. Particular attention is given to models which yield tree structures of similarities between alternatives. Also reviewed are methods for estimating econometric models of probabilistic choice from "point-of-sale" sample surveys.},

	abstract = {Random utility (RU) models are well-established methods for describing discrete choice behavior. Recently, there has been a strong upsurge in interest driven by advances in data gathering and estimation technology. This review paper describes the principles and issues, and develops a taxonomy of three major families of models. The paper summarizes and classifies the different approaches. The advantages and limitations of the various alternatives are outlined. Practical issues in implementing the models are also discussed.},
